### Hey / ÐŸÑ€Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ‚ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vladimir (or _Ð’Ð¾Ð²Ð°_), and I'm a lead developer at [@evilmartians](https://github.com/evilmartians).

I'm currently working on:

- Making real-time Ruby apps rock with [@anycable](https://github.com/anycable) (built with Ruby and Go).
- Bringing edge Ruby features to all Rubies with [@ruby-next](https://github.com/ruby-next)â€”a transpiler for Ruby.
- Helping Ruby devs to write faster tests with [test-prof](https://github.com/palkan/test-prof).
- ...and other projects, such as: [Action Policy](https://github.com/palkan/action_policy), [Logidze](https://github.com/palkan/logidze), [Anyway Config](https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config) and many more.
