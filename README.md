### Hey / ÐŸÑ€Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ‚ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vladimir (or _Ð’Ð¾Ð²Ð°_), and I'm a principal backend engineer at [@evilmartians](https://github.com/evilmartians).

> ðŸ“• My book "Layered design for Ruby on Rails applications" is avalable now: [Amazon](https://packt.link/97LoK) | [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/product/layered-design-for-ruby-on-rails-applications/9781801813785)

I'm currently working on:

- Making real-time Ruby apps rock with [@anycable](https://github.com/anycable) (built with Ruby and Go).
- Bringing edge Ruby features to all Rubies with [@ruby-next](https://github.com/ruby-next)â€”a transpiler for Ruby.
- Helping Ruby devs to write faster tests with [test-prof](https://github.com/palkan/test-prof).
- ...and other projects, such as: [Action Policy](https://github.com/palkan/action_policy), [Logidze](https://github.com/palkan/logidze), [Anyway Config](https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config) and many more.
